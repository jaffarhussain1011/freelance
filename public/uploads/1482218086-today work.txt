Login to redmine and understand requirement/issue
Debug Issue:
Login to application(locally) and verify date difference by visiting edit incident page
Debugged code and verified that timezone conversion is being done on both dates
Requested db data from stagging server for incident mentioned in screenshot.
After viewing db data and data displayed in browser
Edit Incident Block
In db:      2016-10-01 18:55:16.577943
In display: 2016-10-02 3:44:50 am
Events List Block
in db:      2016-10-01 18:44:50
in display: 2016-10-02 12:44:50 PM	

Notes: needs further debugging on table/view from which we are getting data for editIncident, may be we are getting incorrect data.




$date = $this->change_date_timezone_for_display($date);
return  "/Date(" . strtotime($date) . "000)/";

here in these lines:
in first line we are converting utc (received from db) to user timezone(for example gmt+5)
but in second line we are saying that it is in utc because are providing "000" at the end of string.(here it creates issue)
When ignite gird get this string "/Date(1448979763000)/" and then converts to local timezone.
So if we are going to use date fields of ignite ui then we should not convert it to user timezone. we need to provide this in utc,
and ignite grid/javascript do conversion.
